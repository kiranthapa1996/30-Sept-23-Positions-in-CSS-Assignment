      <p>
        An artificial satellite is a human made object which orbits around the earth and other planets in the solar
        system. Artificial satellites are built in order to study the earth and other planets, to help in communication
        and to observe the distance universe. Satellites can also have people in them just like International Space
        stations.
        Soviet Sputnik 1 mission was the first artificial satellite which was launched in 1957. After that many
        countries have launched many satellites and there are around 3000 satellites orbiting the earth currently. It is
        estimated that there are eight thousand pieces of space junk and the dead satellites which are also going around
        the earth. The satellites are launched into various orbits depending upon their function.
